Write a template that will use the properties of sections having false values or an empty list to output the text while using all properties of the hash:

```
{{first_name}}'s Car:
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

Documentation on variables: https://github.com/janl/mustache.js#false-values-or-empty-lists

Your program will receive the hash as stringified json as the only argument.

When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.js
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
